# GNSS_INS_LooseCouple
A C++ Program that calculates GNSS/INS LooseCouple using Kalman Filter.

INS State includes position (3d) / velocity (3d) / attitude (3d) / gyro's bias (3d) / accelerometer's bias (3d) / gyro's scale factor(3d) / accelerometer's scale factor(3d). The state vector is a 21 * 1 vector
